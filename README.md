# Coffee Shop

This was the first programming project I ever did. We were learning Visual Basic at College and so I decided to put my new skills to test and create a 
text based, limited implementation of a Coffee Shop. I asked my teacher for advice and he told me the best thing to do was to try and implement as many
of the skills I have learnt in the program as possible. So I tried to implement as many different things as i could, from Switch Case to different types of
loops to different data types. It ended up being a Coffee Shop with some random questions at the end just because I wanted to implement some new things
I'd learnt.

To develop this program, I used the console application of Visual Basic, on Visual Studio 2015.
